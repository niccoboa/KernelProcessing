# Kernel Image Processing

**Assignments**:
- Template class that represents images with 1, 2, 3 and 4 channels;
- Class that implements kernel image processing;
- Reading and writing in PPM/PGM format.

## TODO:
- More tests for **Unit testing**
- Add more image processing operations (e.g. edge detection, sharpening, etc.)
- New structure for Kernels.h
- A small GUI?
- Skip comments in PPM/PGM files when reading
- Save in binary format as well
- When edge detection, fill the edges with white or black
